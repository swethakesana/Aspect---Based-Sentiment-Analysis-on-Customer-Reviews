# Aspect---Based-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Customer-Reviews
Detailed Approach to Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

To develop an aspect-based sentiment analysis model that can accurately identify and classify sentiments related to different aspects of business reviews, I'll follow a structured approach:

Step 1: Data Preprocessing

Load the review.json file, which contains the full review text data.
Preprocess the review text data by:
Tokenizing the text using NLTK or spaCy.
Removing stop words and punctuation.
Converting all text to lowercase.
Lemmatizing words to their base form.
Step 2: Aspect Extraction

Use a named entity recognition (NER) model or a rule-based approach to extract the following aspects from the review text:
Food Quality
Service
Ambience
Pricing
Cleanliness
Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests) on a labeled dataset to classify each review sentence into one of the above aspects.
Step 3: Sentiment Classification

Use a sentiment analysis model (e.g., VaderSentiment, TextBlob, or a custom-trained model) to classify the sentiment of each review sentence as:
Positive
Negative
Neutral
Train the model on a labeled dataset to learn the sentiment patterns and nuances in the review text.
Step 4: Aspect-Sentiment Pairing

Pair each extracted aspect with its corresponding sentiment classification.
Create a data structure (e.g., a dictionary or a pandas DataFrame) to store the aspect-sentiment pairs for each review.
Step 5: Insights Generation

Analyze the aspect-sentiment pairs to generate insights for each business.
Calculate the overall sentiment score for each aspect and identify areas of strength and weakness.
Provide a structured summary of insights highlighting key areas for businesses to focus on.
Step 6: Model Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the aspect extraction and sentiment classification models using metrics such as:
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix Analysis
Optimize the models by tuning hyperparameters, experimenting with different algorithms, or incorporating additional features.
Step 7: Visualization

Visualize the insights and results using plots and charts in the Jupyter Notebook.
Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create informative and engaging visualizations.
Code Structure

I'll organize the code into separate sections or cells in the Jupyter Notebook, each focusing on a specific step in the approach. I'll use Markdown comments to explain the code and provide clear headings to separate the different sections.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything specific you'd like me to focus on during this challenge.

This code implementation covers the following steps:

Data preprocessing: Tokenize the review text, remove stop words and punctuation, and lemmatize words to their base form.
Aspect extraction: Extract the five aspects (Food Quality, Service, Ambience, Pricing, and Cleanliness) from the review text using a simple rule-based approach.
Sentiment classification: Use the VaderSentiment library to classify the sentiment of each review sentence as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
Aspect-sentiment pairing: Pair each extracted aspect with its corresponding sentiment classification.
Insights generation: Generate insights for each business by calculating the overall sentiment score for each aspect.
Visualization: Visualize the insights using bar plots to show the sentiment scores for each aspect by business.
